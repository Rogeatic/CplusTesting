# Overview

{I wanted to test my ability with c++, because I hadn't used it in a while and I thought it would be usefull to get everything all set up.}

{I made some very inneficient code that just basically gets an input, then calls a function that prints the amount, and counts to it.}

{My main purpose here was to test myself and see if I still remember the syntax. I defitely had to google some stuff, but I did it without any bugs.}

# Development Environment

{I had to get the extension for c++ in visual Studio Code}

{Obviously I used C++, but I had to also make sure the Cude Runner was enabled. I was suprised how much Apple/Microsoft had improved the C++ experience on M1}

# Useful Websites

{Here's the helpful websites I used}

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_classes.asp)
- [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/147710/)

# Future Work

{Here's the things I should add}

- I could add a GPA checker
- Maybe I could make it run better
- I should probably learn about pointers...
